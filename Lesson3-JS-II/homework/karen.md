## for statement
    A for statement is a way to loop through an array one item at a time.

## &&, ||, !
    && = and (double ampersands)
        Both items must be true for the full statement to be true.
        If either item is false, full statement if false
    || = or (double pipes)
        If either or both items are true then statement is true.
        If both items are false then the statement is false.
    ! = negation, opposite, not, the false of, (bang)

## Arrays
    An array is a group/collection of items. It is like an egg carton (array) that holds the eggs (items).
