##Variables
Variables are containers with a "name" were you store information. You can then recall the information later by only using the "name".

##Strings
Strings are information that is text. You need to use quotes (single or double) around the text for the computer to understand to use the text as it was actually written.

##Functions (arguments, return)
Functions are reusable processes or mini programs that you can use/call within your program. Functions take arguments (the information you want to pass to the function). Return is the command at the end of a function to spit out the result. To use a function, one types "functionName(x);" x is the argument you are passing into the function.

##if Statements
If Statements are to check if something is true, return one answer, else return a different answer. If Statements come in a simple form of if/else, more comples are if/else if/..../else.

##Boolean values (true, false)
Booleans come in only two "flavors" true and false. You can also think of them as yes/no, there is no other option.
